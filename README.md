This repository contains a deep learning model for movie genre classification using poster images. 
The model is a CNN-RNN hybrid that extracts spatial and sequential features from the posters. 
Significant changes in validation loss and precision were monitored to evaluate the model's performance.
The model demonstrates effective generalization and competitive accuracy in predicting genres, making it a robust tool for automated genre classification based on visual content.
